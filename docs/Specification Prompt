I want to create a specification for the redesign and development of BillRice.com.

BillRice.com should be a hub for a comprehensive and well rounded picture of Bill Rice as a strategic, thought leader in the areas of marketing, lead generation, fintech, emerging tech trends. 

Use Perplexity MCP and Firecrawl MCP to:
1. Gain a better understanding of Bill Rice and all of his strategic perspectives and personas
2. Gather images and assets to use in the website, including interesting or relevant links
3. Create a clear and concise positioning and copy for the website
4. A better understanding of how to organize all of the many facets of "Bill Rice" to create the most authoritative and complete picture of who Bill Rice is and how he can add value.

Ideally, it would be a one stop resource for:

1. Bill Rice bio and headshots. 
2. Primary point of acquisition for subscribers to my newsletter: MyExecutiveBrief.com 
3. Hub for all of my Gumroad products (primarily playbooks)

5. Hub for indexing all of my latest YouTube videos and podcast appearances
6. Access point to my /now page to share what I am working on and interested in
7. Hub for my core essays - infrequent thought and philosophical pieces

This should be a more refined version of this: https://billricelinktree.com/
I kind of like this website as a model and inspiration: https://www.gregisenberg.com/
